This is a harmless virus that is programmed in Visual Basic Script (VBS). 
It starts with a simple IQ test, but when your done it says it found a virus, 
when you click Delete it shuts down after 60 seconds.
If you click to ignore it opens cmd prompt files until your ram gives it up.

NOTE: its a harmful virus and the worst that can happen is your pc runs into a bsod, which is fixed by a simple reboot.
